        <h3><ins>History of Pilibhit</ins></h3><br><br>
        <p> Pilibhit forests area are a home for the striped cats, tiger, bear, and many species of birds. A proposal, created in 2005, to make a home for the endangered cats in Pilibhit forests was sent to the government of India in April 2008.[9] was declared in September 2008 based on its special type of ecosystem with vast open spaces and sufficient feed for the elegant predators. It is believed by locals that Pilibhit was ruled by an ancient king named Mayurdhwaj or Moredhwaj or King Venu, a great devotee of lord Krishna and a loyal friend of Arjun. King Venu's name and the geography of his kingdom can be traced in the Hindu epic Mahabharat. Jamia Mosque in the 1780s. The city Pilibhit was an administrative unit in the Mughal era under Bareilly suba. For security, the Mughal subedar Ali Mohammed Khan constructed four magnificent gates around the administrative building in 1734  AD. These gates were named Barellwi Darwaza at the west, Hussaini Darwaza at the east, Jahanabadi Darwaza at the north and Dakhini Darwaza at the south. Because of a lack of proper maintenance, all the gates have been lost; only their ruins remain. He also constructed a Jama Masjid in Pilibhit. The last king of the Shah dynasty of Doti, Nepal, Prithvipati Shah, was sheltered in Pilibhit by the ruler of Rampur State Faizullah Khan in 1789 AD, after being attacked by the Gorkha Kingdom of Nepal. The freedom fighter Maulana Inayatullah, from Pilibhit, voluntarily hosted the exiled Queen of Avadh, Begum Hazrat Mahal, who reached Nepal in late 1859.</p>
